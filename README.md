# ðŸš¦NYC-2020-Collision- Power BI Dashboard


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
A group project analyzing NYC traffic collisions in 2020 (Janâ€“Aug) using Maven Analytics data. The goal was to uncover trends in collisions, injuries, and fatalities.


## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query & data modeling  
- DAX for KPIs  
- Dashboard storytelling & visualization  


## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- 74,881 traffic collisions across New York City.  
- Attributes: borough, time of day, cause of collision, casualties.  


## ðŸ”‘ Process
- Cleaned and transformed dataset (renamed columns, changed data types).  
- Normalized dataset using unpivot.  
- Built relationships in data model.  
- Created KPIs: total collisions, injuries, fatalities.  
- Designed dashboard with cards, bar charts, matrices, and pies.  


## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Collisions dropped sharply during Marchâ€“April 2020 lockdown.  
- 27,448 injuries and 144 deaths in 8 months.  
- Afternoons & evenings were riskiest.  
- Brooklyn had the most crashes, Staten Island the fewest.  
- Leading cause: driver inattention/distraction.  


## âœ¨ Recommendations
1. Reduce driver distraction through stricter penalties and awareness.  
2. Increase traffic enforcement during peak hours.  
3. Improve winter road safety measures.  
4. Target Brooklyn with stronger safety interventions.  
5. Expand pedestrian & cyclist protection.  

## âœ¨ Reflection
This project stretched me beyond basics, showing me the depth of Power BI and the importance of tackling challenging datasets.
